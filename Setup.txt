      Obtaining Packages
-------------------------------

This program requires you have Python installed. If you don't, please visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and obtain a copy. This program was coded in Python 3. During the install, MAKE SURE YOU add Python to the PATH. Very important.

The next thing you'll need to do is install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file. If you have installed python to the path, it should be as simple as opening a command prompt, and typing in "pip install (package name)".
 
If you have not installed Python to the path, you will need to locate your Python folder. The default install location for Python is "C:\Users\YOUR ACC NAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonX". Once inside this folder, open the "Scripts" folder. Now copy the path to the "Scripts" folder, open a command prompt and type in "cd ". After this, paste your copied path. Press enter. This should take you to the "Scripts" folder inside your command prompt. The command looks like this:

cd C:\Users\Ricochet\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37

After this, you should be able to use pip to install Python packages (only in that command prompt. If you leave that command prompt but want to install more packages, you'll have to navigate to your "Scripts" folder agains).

   Storing/Editing the files
-------------------------------

Setup for this program requires you to edit 7 lines in the FirefoxProfiles.py file, 4 in the backupGui.py file, 2 in the rmBackup.py file, and move four folders to their permanent homes.

The first thing you will do is find the permanent homes of your files. I store mine in %appdata%/Roaming, because that is where Mozilla Firefox is installed by default. To access Roaming on your windows machine, click the search bar on your task bar, type in %appdata% and press enter. Then, just plop your files right in. 

The next task is to edit the files so that they correctly point to where each folder/file is stored.
The lines will be near the top of each file, and be marked with "#EDIT ME" just above them.

These lines point the program to the stored location of Firefox's session restore files, and also to where you want the stored location of this program to be. I'll go over each of them below.

Firstly, each of the .py files you will be editing are located in the FirefoxProfilesMaster folder. 

To repeat, the files we are editing are: FirefoxProfiles.py, backupGui.py, and rmBackup.py. They can be edited with notepad.


FirefoxProfiles.py

The first line we will be editing is the Profiles variable. It looks like this:

Profiles = "C:/Users/Ricochet/AppData/Roaming/Firefox Profiles"

If you stored your folders in %appdata%/Roaming (That is where Mozilla Firefox is installed by default anyway), then the only thing you have to change here is "Ricochet" to your computer's account name. 
If you don't want your program to be stored where Mozilla Firefox is stored, or you have a custom location, find the location in your file explorer and copy the path (The thing above your file list in explorer, looks something like this: Computer > Documents > example > folder). Once you've copied it, delete the old path and paste the copied path in between the quotation marks ("). It is very important for there to be quotation marks on each side of the path. There is one more thing we have to do. Your copied path probably has backslashes (\) instead of forward slashes (/). Backslashes have special functions in Python, so we'll have to change that. Replace each backslash with a forward slash. 


Next line is:

ProfilesBS = "C:/Users/Ricochet/AppData/Roaming/Firefox ProfilesBS"

This one is the same as the line before.


Next line is:

ProfilesBE = "C:/Users/Ricochet/AppData/Roaming/Firefox ProfilesBE"

This line is the same as the Profiles line.


Next line is:

MasterProfiles = "C:/Users/Ricochet/AppData/Roaming/FirefoxProfilesMaster/Profiles.txt"

This line is the same as the Profiles line.


Next line is:

sessionBackups = "C:/Users/Ricochet/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/cndxvxhm.default/sessionstore-backups"

This is the first line that is different. This line points to a folder generated by Mozilla Firefox. If you have NOT changed Firefox's install location (you can check this by navigating to %appdata%/Roaming and finding your Mozilla folder), then all you need to change is the "Ricochet" in the path. 
If you have created a custom install folder for Firefox, then you need to locate that and copy the path. Replace the path inbetween the quotation marks in the file, and paste your new path into the old one's place. Remember to replace each backslash (\) with a forward slash (/), as Python uses backslashes for special functions.


Next line is:

sessionStore = "C:/Users/Ricochet/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/cndxvxhm.default/sessionstore.jsonlz4"

This line is the same as the line above, it points to a file that is generated by Mozilla Firefox. Note that is file is only present when Firefox has been closed using the X in the top right corner of the window, or Mozilla's dedicated exit button.


Next line is:

mozillaSessionBackups = "C:/Users/Ricochet/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/cndxvxhm.default"

This line is the same as the sessionBackups line.


We are finished with the first file, now we will move onto the next file (backupGui.py). The process for changing these paths are all very similar.

The first line is:

Profiles = "C:/Users/Ricochet/AppData/Roaming/Firefox Profiles"

You'll notice this is the first line we did. The process for changing it is also the same.


Next line is:

ProfilesBS = "C:/Users/Ricochet/AppData/Roaming/Firefox ProfilesBS"

The process is the same as the line above, or the first line we did.


Next line is:

ProfilesBE = "C:/Users/Ricochet/AppData/Roaming/Firefox ProfilesBE"

The process is the same as the first line we did. 


Next line is:
MasterProfiles = "C:/Users/Ricochet/AppData/Roaming/FirefoxProfilesMaster/Profiles.txt"

This process is the same as the first line we did.


We are finished with the second file. The third file, rmBackup.py, is the same process as the second file. It even has similar lines.


Now, as long as you have correctly placed each of the four folders that come with this program into their homes, and modified each line to reflect those locations, then the program should run. I recommend you read the Usage file, as it goes over basic usage as well as some things you shouldn't do.
